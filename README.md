# demo-weather-app

An Android weather demo app to try out several features such as the newer android architecture components.

## installation

Clone this repository and import into **Android Studio**

`git clone https://github.com/danarcheronline/demo-weather-app`

## Background Story
While studying Android development there was a number of features I wanted to try putting into one app.

I saw a weather app pop up in numerous tutorials and google code labs so I decided to cram all the stuff I wanted to try into a weather app.

I later found out that udacity has an entire android course which helps you buid a weather app as you go so that was extremely useful.

The UI is minimal, the images taken from Udacities weather app, and features I was not concerned with are still not implemented.

After going through the features I wanted to try out, I kind of liked the idea of a weather app and am considering properly designing and publishing one to the google play store.

## Features/Components Of Concern
Most of the features I wanted to try out are broken down by the branches, but here is a list of them anyway:
- Room
- LiveData
- ViewModel
- Repository
- RecyclerView
- Preference Fragment
- API and JSON Parsing ([Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/))
- Singleton Pattern
- Dependency Injection
- Threading Executors
